# ib-chat
A chat designated specifically for ib students

# What is this for?
This chat was done specifically with ib students in mind.
For now it is very simple, but if a lot of people start 
using it will see major updates. This was done in under
3 hours and as a main goal I would like to collect as many
messages as I can because I want to use the data for a 
neural network. 
Hopefully this will also count as CAS. 

# Languages/frameworks used
HTML
CSS (materialize)
JavaScript (node, angular and jQuery)

# About me
I'm in the class of 2018, taking HL: Maths, Phys and Lang B,
SL: Bio, Econ and Eng A. I really like web-dev and have 
experience also with PHP, Python and Java.
